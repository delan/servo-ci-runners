# The fallback network config is inappropriate for our needs, because it bakes

# This network config will survive cloning, but for some reason, maybe a bug,
# we have to write the file and bring the network up ourselves. If we use a
# network-config file, cloud-init will write the file and `netplan generate`,
# but never seems to actually apply it. When this happens, the guest will hang
# for a while, blocking cloud-init and leaving us with an unreachable guest.
